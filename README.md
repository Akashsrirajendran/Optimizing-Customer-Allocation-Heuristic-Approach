# Optimizing-Customer-Allocation-Heuristic-Approach
This repository presents a detailed examination of customer allocation strategies for an installation company in Great Britain. Drawing on heuristic algorithms investigated by Haket, Rhee, and Swart (2020), the project aims to minimize travel time, costs, and carbon emissions associated with technician visits to customers. The analysis utilizes population data sourced from the Office for National Statistics and geospatial data from the Open Geography portal to calculate travel distances between regional facilities and customer locations. Through the implementation of Greedy Randomised Adaptive (GA) and First Improvement (FI) algorithms, efficient customer allocation solutions are proposed. Additionally, sensitivity analysis is conducted to assess the impact of varying parameters such as capacity relaxation and reallocation cost. The optimization efforts result in a significant reduction in total travel time, with observed figures dropping from 73690.07 hours (GA) to 68319.5 hours (FI) post-optimization. Furthermore, specific facilities are identified, with 'Runcorn' emerging as the primary service provider and 'Exeter' serving the least number of customers following the optimization process. This repository offers valuable insights into heuristic-based approaches for optimizing customer allocation, catering to the needs of installation service providers.
